# Employee List
This assignment has challenged me 100%, I believe this is the first assignment I have not been able to fully complete and it is extremely disappointing. I am submitting it uncompleted because I am truly stuck and do not know where else to go to continue.

*EDIT*: I went back and added the mainMenu() at the end of each case to prevent the CLI from exiting out of the question prompt after answering each question, I am still unable to get the update employee to work correctly.
